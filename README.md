# Data cleaning and visualization project of a cargo vessel manifest

## Introduction
In this project I utilized the _tidyverse_ package in R to clean and transform and a badly structured dataset. 

## About data
The dataset contains shipping information for and fees paid for shipping to two destinations in North America. 
The variables in the dataset are:
- ship mode (first class, same day, second class, standard class)
- order id
- price
- country
- segmment (consumer, corporate, home office)

## The process
The data was imported using the _read_csv_ function from the tidyverse package, data was transposed and then clean to remove missing observations and extract year, country and order id.
